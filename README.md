This is a simple webpage for my music account, using HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT.<br />
This website was created by following a tutorial from the Youtube channel (freecodecamp.org with Beau Carnes as the instructor) and using<br />
a free template (from templated.co).
I am greatly thankful to those who provided this incredible opportunity.
